# Linux-inter-process-communication-IPC-
The System V and POSIX specifications have different APIs for using basically the same three IPC mechanisms including message queues, semaphores, and shared memory My goal was simply to demonstrate each IPC mechanism for each API in a set of very simple programs. Here I demonstrate an IPC project between a parent process and a forked child process.
